He utilizes Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze biomedical text.
At Penn, he joined the <a href="https://greenelab.com">Greenelab</a> in 2017 and was appointed as a trainee on the T32 Computational Genomics training grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).
He has presented at the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Rocky Mountain Bioinformatics  conference, Cold Spring Harbor's Biological Data Science Symposium, and was invited to speak at Elsevier's Labs Online Lecture series. 
He graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) with a B.S. degree in Computer Science and a minor in Bioinformatics. 
During his time at UMBC, he was a part of the Meyerhoff Scholars program (M23) and was appointed as a Marc U*Star Scholar.
While he is not working in the lab, he spends his time investing in the stock/crypto market and playing on his PS4 or Nintendo Switch Lite.
As he advances towards the end of his Ph.D. journey, he seeks to become a data scientist where he can continue to improve and use his analytical skills.
