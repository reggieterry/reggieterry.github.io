I am a recent graduate with a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) degree and have 15+ years of extensive experience in the Hospitality Industry. 
My dissertation focused on analyzing contrastive leadership styles within the hospitality industry, where I examined which leadership style best suits this diverse industry.
During my dissertation experience, I developed a moderate amount of programming experience focused on data analytics and visualization.

Before obtaining my DBA, I worked within the hospitality industry, where my duties included handling public relations, managing/training employees, maintaining payroll, and spearheading food services for large companies.
Furthermore, I developed excellent interpersonal and leadership skills and exemplary writing and communication skills throughout his career. 
Similarly, I developed a strong knowledge of social media tools as I was tasked to promote company products and events. 
After spending several years in the hospitality industry, I realized that my talents are best suited for education.
Therefore, I am currently seeking to shift my focus from working in the hospitality industry to teaching.
