Recent Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) graduate who is highly
motivated, creative, and results-driven with 21+ years of professional
experience in hospitality and management. While working in this
industry, I managed guest services, handled public relations, trained
and supervised employees, maintained records for events, taught
individuals to improve their professional development, and spearheaded
food safety and services for companies and organizations. I'm seeking to
shift careers to become a Marketing/Sales Manager or a similar position
that will allow me to refine my vast business knowledge within an
industry setting.
