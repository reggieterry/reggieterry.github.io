# Struggles of Job Hunting in the Pandemic

Job hunting is really difficult in this day and time. 
With millions of people out of work and companies looking for employees, why are people having a rough time getting back to work? 
We all have seen the stories of "The Great Resignation" and wondered; why aren't companies doing more to hire and retain employees? 
I recently graduated with my Doctorate in Business Administration from Northcentral University. 
I am looking for a career transition into the education field. 
I want to become a instructor at a community college or university. 
The issue I am running into is that when these online programs say they can help you acheive that possibility, they forgot to mention one thing. 
That it will be at your own hard work. 
I have searched online for weeks now looking for opportunities to teach with no feedback or anything. 

One thing I have noticed while searching for work is that many of these schools or organizations that post on these job boards (LinkedIn and Indeed) have is the reoccurance of positions. 
The one position that I see frequently is for "adjunct instructor or professor". 
Given the number of students that are in colleges and universities, why is it that you haven't filled these positions already? 
What is the real reason you are looking for these positions? 
Is there something you are not divulging to the applicant and hoping that they take a bite? 

Another thing I am running into with the job hunt is the ATS systems that companies use to "weed" out applications that don't "fit" their requirements.
These systems are designed to have specific keywords that companies are looking for in the applicant's resume that pertain to the job description.
The computer program looks at the resume and determines that if those words are not in the resume, then the applicant is not a match for the system. 
But here is the funny part, why does a computer have to determine whether an applicant is a match or not? 
What happened to the old way of calling up a potential applicant and asking a few questions over the phone? 
So when did a computer have the know how to determine that a person is qualified for a position without seeing that person? 
Understand that I do know a little about HR and what they do, but in my eyes these ATS systems are pretty outdated and ancient.
