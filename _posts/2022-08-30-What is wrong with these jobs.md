## What is wrong with the job market?

I have been unemployed now since April 2022 and I have a few questions to ask the job market? 
WHY ARE YOU STUPID!!!! 
Don't you understand that people are not putting up with your bullshit!! 
The average person is told that their position requires them to do one specific thing. 
But companies have the audacity to force them to complete several other tasks that they are not either trained to do or not written in the original description. 
And they wonder why their employees are quitting. 
Or now the trend it "quiet quitting" where the employee is only doing what is required of the position. 
What is it gonna take for these companies to realize that the employee's worth is more than the dollar they are getting. 
When will companies realize that in order to get the worker to perform and produce the output that will make the company profits go up that they have to "pay a livable wage" comparable to what is considered "livable". 
When will the organizational structure of these companies understand that in order to accomplish futuristic things and be a leader in the 21st century, some of the "top brass" needs to pack up and move out and let the ones under them a chance to show them how it's done. 
I just think it's funny that these "CEOs" who are one or two years away from getting social security think that they know what is best for the company.
