## August 17- Another Failed Application Process

So another application gone down the drain. 
I applied to the Northern Virginia Community College System and it was for the perfect job. 
It was a adjunct position teaching Hospitality and Tourism at Northern Virginia Community College. 
The funniest thing is that I have over 15 years in the industry. 
The hiring person even asked me to submit my undergrad and masters transcripts to see what courses in hospitality I have taken. 


My resume/cv has countless positions on there in hospitality from working in restaurants to working for my undergrad's catering service within the school. 
I have four degrees and years of experience and what does all that mean when I can't even get a simple teaching position in the field I have experience in.
What does that say about the teaching profession in general? 
I have done everything possible to set myself apart from all the applicants out there. 
I have revamped my resume more times than I can count. 
I have reworded and redefined every role and position I have done. 


What else is there to do in order to make sure that I have a shot at getting a position with a company. 
I am trying not to get frustrated about this but everything in me is just screaming loudly.
