# What is up with these Job Descriptions and the Job Market? 

Have you ever wondered about what analysts mean when they say it is an "employee's market"?
Or that the job market is working in the employee's favor? 
How do they know this? 
What magical tools do they have to say that it is in our favor? 
Looking at several job descriptions, I have come across a total oxymoron within some. 
The job posting states that the position is "entry level". 
But the position requires a minimum of 1 to 3 years of experience. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but when did an entry level position require someone to have "experience"? 
So what you are telling me is that a college graduate with NO experience is excluded from applying to your position? 
Or someone who has 5+ years of experience in another company and is looking for a career change is excluded? 
Companies have decided that in order to get the perfect candidate for their positions, they are upping the stakes when it comes to the requirements for the position. 
News flash!! There is no such thing as a perfect candidate! 
The job requirements written for these descriptions are very complex and unattainable. 
A job description may require a person to have a bachelors degree along with several different requirements such as "knowledge in marketing, finance, and economics". 
Why is it that these entry level positions are requiring this knowledge? 
What I have learned from all my years in the hospitality/business industry, any position that calls for entry level position means that the person doesn't have any experience and the company is willing to train them. 
That is the perfect job for the recent college graduate who is looking to make their mark in the industry. 

So why are all the companies now requiring experience with all the entry level positions? 
My guess is that they don't want to pay the amount it cost to train someone brand new to the industry. 
They are looking to "pocket" that money for their profit. 
Another guess is that hiring someone with a little bit of experience means that its less training for the company to do when it comes to specific programs that are utilized.
