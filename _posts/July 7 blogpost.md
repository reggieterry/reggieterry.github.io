#What is up with these Job Descriptions and the Job Market? 

Have you ever wondered about what analysts mean when they say it is an "employee's market"?
Or that the job market is working in the employee's favor? 
How do they know this? 
What magical tools do they have to say that it is in our favor? 
Looking at several job descriptions, I have come across a total oxymoron within some. 
The job posting states that the position is "entry level". 
But the position requires a minimum of 1 to 3 years of experience. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but when did an entry level position require someone to have "experience"? 
So what you are telling me is that a college graduate with NO experience is excluded from applying to your position? 
Or someone who has 5+ years of experience in another company and is looking for a career change is excluded?
