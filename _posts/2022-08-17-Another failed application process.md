## August 17- Another Failed Application Process

So another application gone down the drain. 
I applied to the Northern Virginia Community College System and it was for the perfect job. 
It was a adjunct position teaching Hospitality and Tourism at Northern Virginia Community College. 
The funniest thing is that I have over 15 years in the industry. 
The hiring person even asked me to submit my undergrad and masters transcripts to see what courses in hospitality I have taken. 


My resume/cv has countless positions on there in hospitality from working in restaurants to working for my undergrad's catering service within the school. 
I have four degrees and years of experience and what does all that mean when I can't even get a simple teaching position in the field I have experience in.
What does that say about the teaching profession in general? 
I have done everything possible to set myself apart from all the applicants out there. 
I have revamped my resume more times than I can count. 
I have reworded and redefined every role and position I have done. 


What else is there to do in order to make sure that I have a shot at getting a position with a company. 
I am trying not to get frustrated about this but everything in me is just screaming loudly. 
It seems that everyone is having issues with getting hired these days. 
I have a friend who has a PhD. and when they applied for a position they were told that the work he did in his program doesn't count for work experience. 
So how can someone who has been in school for several years getting an education get experience in the workforce? 
How can someone who is coming out of college with a bachelors degree supposed to have at least two to three years of experience in the position they apply for? 
None of this makes any sense in the real world! 
But when you have people who don't even like doing their own job just copy and paste a description about a job and post it as their own position, what else can you expect from these companies? 

I have reached out to the HR of the system and asked what things I did wrong and what I need to improve on to get the position. 
I am waiting for a response from them. 
The problem is that they will take forever to get back to me and I already know it will be just some crappy excuse that they will throw together to make me believe that I need to fix something. 
I am just frustrated and upset that nothing I do will make any difference in the situation. 
It is really pushing my buttons that no one will give me a chance to show my worth and my knowledge. 
It is really funny that these companies can tell a person's worth and knowledge by what KEYWORDS they put in their resume? 
The only thing those words tell me is that the person can read and figure out that those are the words that I need to put in my resume to get a job. 
It also tells me that the system is broken and needs to be fixed pronto. 

Companies use the ATS or Applicant Tracking System to filter out the applications that come into their system. The HR manager puts certain keywords into the system and the computer looks for those words in the resume and it scores them on the number of words the person has. 
If the application or resume has a high number of those keywords, then they will stay in the system. 
If they don't then the system kicks it out and the application/resume is rejected.
