# The Perils of Career Change 

Since 2020, there have been millions of jobs lost due to the pandemic. 
Companies have had to shut their doors and countless of employees have lost jobs and careers. 
Companies in various industries have seen a number of their workers leave or quit because of poor working conditions. 
I was one of them. 
When the pandemic began, I was working part time at AutoZone and going to school full time getting my doctorate degree. 
I was only working there to get some extra income while going to school. 
I knew that with my educational background and experience that I would be able to get a job really easy. 
What I didn't count on was that companies really don't look at your education and what type of degree you have. 
The only thing they are very adamant on is if you have the experience to do the job they require. 

So what should someone who is looking for a change in their career do? 
What I have been finding out from friends in the HR industry is that you need to go back and re-evaluate your previous jobs. 
What did you do in those positions that are "transferrable skill sets"? 
How can your experience in those positions be used in the career you are trying to enter? 
Another thing I have found out is when looking for those jobs, pick out the skills required and try to match them up with the skills that you have. 
The understanding that I am gathering from all these obstacles is that the education component is not what it used to be. 
Given that many of these companies are now looking for people with a lot of computer, technical, and technology skills, is it suffice to say that the education system is broken? 
Are we putting more of an emphasis on getting that degree when we actually don't need it? 
Or are we focusing on the wrong things when it comes to the getting the education? 

I started this journey because I wanted to make a big career change. 
I was tired of working long hours at dead end jobs. 
I wanted a different experience when it comes to working. 
The way that I have always been told to do was to go to school and get your education and degree and work your way up the ladder of success. 
Now that I have ALL the degrees out there, what happens? 
How can I take what I have learned over the last 13 years and relate it to what type of experience these companies are requiring for these positions? 
It's beginning to become a struggle in looking for employment because the skills are becoming clouded.
