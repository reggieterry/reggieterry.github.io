# Struggles of Job Hunting in the Pandemic

Job hunting is really difficult in this day and time. 
With millions of people out of work and companies looking for employees, why are people having a rough time getting back to work? 
We all have seen the stories of "The Great Resignation" and wondered; why aren't companies doing more to hire and retain employees? 
I recently graduated with my Doctorate in Business Administration from Northcentral University. 
I am looking for a career transition into the education field. 
I want to become a instructor at a community college or university. 
The issue I am running into is that when these online programs say they can help you acheive that possibility, they forgot to mention one thing. 
That it will be at your own hard work. 
I have searched online for weeks now looking for opportunities to teach with no feedback or anything. 

One thing I have noticed while searching for work is that many of these schools or organizations that post on these job boards (LinkedIn and Indeed) have is the reoccurance of positions. 
The one position that I see frequently is for "adjunct instructor or professor". 
Given the number of students that are in colleges and universities, why is it that you haven't filled these positions already? 
What is the real reason you are looking for these positions? 
Is there something you are not divulging to the applicant and hoping that they take a bite? 

Another thing I am running into with the job hunt is the ATS systems that companies use to "weed" out applications that don't "fit" their requirements.
These systems are designed to have specific keywords that companies are looking for in the applicant's resume that pertain to the job description.
The computer program looks at the resume and determines that if those words are not in the resume, then the applicant is not a match for the system. 
But here is the funny part, why does a computer have to determine whether an applicant is a match or not? 
What happened to the old way of calling up a potential applicant and asking a few questions over the phone? 
So when did a computer have the know how to determine that a person is qualified for a position without seeing that person? 
Understand that I do know a little about HR and what they do, but in my eyes these ATS systems are pretty outdated and ancient.

# The Perils of Career Change 

Since 2020, there have been millions of jobs lost due to the pandemic. 
Companies have had to shut their doors and countless of employees have lost jobs and careers. 
Companies in various industries have seen a number of their workers leave or quit because of poor working conditions. 
I was one of them. 
When the pandemic began, I was working part time at AutoZone and going to school full time getting my doctorate degree. 
I was only working there to get some extra income while going to school. 
I knew that with my educational background and experience that I would be able to get a job really easy. 
What I didn't count on was that companies really don't look at your education and what type of degree you have. 
The only thing they are very adamant on is if you have the experience to do the job they require. 

So what should someone who is looking for a change in their career do? 
What I have been finding out from friends in the HR industry is that you need to go back and re-evaluate your previous jobs. 
What did you do in those positions that are "transferrable skill sets"? 
How can your experience in those positions be used in the career you are trying to enter? 
Another thing I have found out is when looking for those jobs, pick out the skills required and try to match them up with the skills that you have. 
The understanding that I am gathering from all these obstacles is that the education component is not what it used to be. 
Given that many of these companies are now looking for people with a lot of computer, technical, and technology skills, is it suffice to say that the education system is broken? 
Are we putting more of an emphasis on getting that degree when we actually don't need it? 
Or are we focusing on the wrong things when it comes to the getting the education? 

I started this journey because I wanted to make a big career change. 
I was tired of working long hours at dead end jobs. 
I wanted a different experience when it comes to working. 
The way that I have always been told to do was to go to school and get your education and degree and work your way up the ladder of success. 
Now that I have ALL the degrees out there, what happens? 
How can I take what I have learned over the last 13 years and relate it to what type of experience these companies are requiring for these positions? 
It's beginning to become a struggle in looking for employment because the skills are becoming clouded.

#What is up with these Job Descriptions and the Job Market? 

Have you ever wondered about what analysts mean when they say it is an "employee's market"?
Or that the job market is working in the employee's favor? 
How do they know this? 
What magical tools do they have to say that it is in our favor? 
Looking at several job descriptions, I have come across a total oxymoron within some. 
The job posting states that the position is "entry level". 
But the position requires a minimum of 1 to 3 years of experience. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but when did an entry level position require someone to have "experience"? 
So what you are telling me is that a college graduate with NO experience is excluded from applying to your position? 
Or someone who has 5+ years of experience in another company and is looking for a career change is excluded?
