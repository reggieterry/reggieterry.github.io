    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a rising 6th year Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) in the <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/">Genomics and Computational Biology </a> program.
      I gradudated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County in 2015 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Bioinformatics.
      I joined the <a href="https://greenelab.com">Greenelab</a>  in 2017, where most of my research focuses on using statistical and deep learning techniques to uncover latent knowledge within biomedical literature.
      During my tenure at Penn, I was appointed as a trainee on the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) T32 Computational Genomics training grant.
      As I advance towards the end of my Ph.D., I aim to continue improving my analytic skills and aspire to become a data scientist that focuses on applying deep learning techniques within the industrial field.
